## Who am I ?

I am a 9th grader in France and a computer enjoyer. 

## About me

-> I know Python and Rust, as well as bribes of Java, HTML and CSS, even though I haven't taken interest in these that much. <br>
-> I am fascinated by OS devs and the low-level in general, that's why I'm trying to get better at Rust and maybe even get my hands on some C and assembly <br>
-> I am a fanatic of FOSS and Linux. I daily drive Arch BTW ! I also firmly recommend Garuda Linux because it's done me well in the past and works like a charm. <a href="https://garudalinux.org/" title="Their website"> Their website</a> <br>

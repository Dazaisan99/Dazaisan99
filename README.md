I am a 9th grader in France and a computer enjoyer. 

I am learning python and Java at the moment, even though I very probably will learn more programming languages in the future.
I use Linux (Garuda Linux) and I am trying to understand how it works :)
I am looking for little projects for fun and eventually bigger ideas to get better at programming.

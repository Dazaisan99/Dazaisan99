-> I am fascinated by OS devs and the low-level in general, that's why I'm trying to get better at Rust and maybe even get my hands on some C and assembly <br>
-> I am a FOSS and Linux enjoyer. I daily drive Arch BTW ! I also firmly recommend Garuda Linux because it's done me well in the past and works like a charm. <a href="https://garudalinux.org/" title="Their website"> Their website</a> <br>
